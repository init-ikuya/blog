# Launched LLM-Werewolf !!

Hello, viewers!

Today I want to announce that I launched LLM-Werewolf, which is a game where you play against and collaborate with LLM agents.

In this game, you and the LLM agents will be divided into two sides: the human side and the werewolf side.

The goal of this game depends on which side you are on. If you are on the human side, you will try to identify and exile the werewolves who are trying to blend in. If you are on the werewolf side, you will try to eliminate all the humans.

If you want to know more details about the werewolf game, please refer to other sites for more information.

In this game's interface, there are 4 sections: Header Section, Player Section, Chat Section, and Action Section. Let's take a look at each section.

In the Header Section, you can check the game status.

In the Player Section, you can find information about yourself and the LLM agents, such as whether they are alive or dead, and even their roles when you have a specific role.

In the Chat Section, you can communicate with LLM agents and receive system messages.

In the Action Section, you can perform various actions depending on your role, such as voting, investigation, and so on.

## Give it a try!

I made this game just for fun, so feel free to check it out! It's pretty interesting to see how AI agents play werewolf - sometimes they're surprisingly good, sometimes... not so much üòÖ

Anyway, hope you enjoy it! Let me know if you find any bugs or have suggestions.

Happy gaming! üê∫
