# Launched Kasukabe Tsumugi Follower Add-on Wiki !!

Hey everyone!

I'm thrilled to announce the release of the **Kasukabe Tsumugi Follower Add-on Wiki** alongside the v1.0.0 official release of the add-on itself!

## What is this?

If you haven't heard of it yet, **Kasukabe Tsumugi Follower Add-on** is a Minecraft Bedrock Edition add-on that lets you adventure with Kasukabe Tsumugi — a character from [VOICEVOX](https://voicevox.hiroshiba.jp/) — as your AI companion. And now, there's a full wiki site to go along with it!

The wiki is built with [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/) and hosted on GitHub Pages.

Check it out here: [Kasukabe Tsumugi Follower Add-on Wiki](https://init-ikuya.github.io/kasukabe-tsumugi-follower-mcaddon-wiki/)

## What's in the Wiki?

The wiki covers everything you need to know about the add-on, organized into three main sections:

### Guide

- **Introduction** — Overview of the add-on and system requirements
- **Installation** — Step-by-step setup for Windows, iOS, and Android
- **Getting Started** — A 7-step walkthrough from summoning Tsumugi to becoming best friends
- **FAQ** — Answers to common questions and troubleshooting tips

### Features

The add-on has a ton of features, and each one gets its own detailed page:

- **Taming** — Feed her curry for a 100% tame rate!
- **Affection System** — 5 relationship levels from Stranger to Best Friend, with unique voice lines at each stage
- **Combat** — She'll fight alongside you against monsters, with auto-retreat when low on HP
- **Equipment** — Give her swords, axes, tridents, armor, and shields — all visually reflected on the character
- **Follow & Navigation** — Auto-follow, teleportation, and cross-dimension travel support
- **Voice System** — 45 unique voice lines generated with VOICEVOX
- **Curry Item** — Craftable curry with a custom recipe (bowl + baked potato + carrot + steak + wheat)
- **UI Menu** — Status display, follow/wait commands, and equipment management

### Reference

- **Stats** — Full damage tables, armor values, durability numbers
- **Voice Lines** — Complete list of all 45 voice lines with their trigger conditions
- **Commands** — Useful commands for summoning, teleporting, and more
- **Changelog** — Full version history

## What's New in v1.0.0?

The v1.0.0 release brings some major additions:

- **Equipment durability system** with UI display
- **Enchantment preservation** when swapping or dropping equipment
- **Auto combat mode termination** when no monsters are nearby
- **Craftable curry recipe** that unlocks when you obtain a bowl
- **Wild Tsumugi behavior** — she spawns near beds and wanders within 30 blocks
- Various bug fixes and voice optimizations

## Why I made this

I wanted to create a comprehensive, searchable documentation site so players can easily find information about all the add-on's features. VitePress was a perfect fit — it's fast, supports Japanese content well, and the local search feature works great.

## Give it a try!

Download the add-on from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft-bedrock/addons/kasukabe-tsumugi-follower) and check out the [Wiki](https://init-ikuya.github.io/kasukabe-tsumugi-follower-mcaddon-wiki/) for the full guide.

Happy crafting! ⛏️
