# Launched AI-Driven PSD Layer Combiner !!

Hey everyone!

I'm excited to announce my new project: **AI-Driven PSD Layer Combiner**!

## What is it?

This is a web-based tool that leverages the power of GPT-4o to analyze PSD file layers and automatically select the optimal combinations. If you've ever spent hours manually toggling through different layer combinations in Photoshop, this tool is for you!

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Uses GPT-4o to intelligently analyze your PSD layers
- **Automatic Combination**: No more manual toggling - let AI find the best layer combinations
- **Web-Based**: Works right in your browser, no installation required
- **Free to Use**: Yes, it's completely free!

## How it works

1. Upload your PSD file
2. The tool extracts and analyzes the layers
3. GPT-4o processes the layer information and determines optimal combinations
4. You get the results automatically!

## Why I made this

As someone who works with design files, I know how tedious it can be to manually go through different layer combinations, especially when dealing with complex PSD files with many variations. I wanted to automate this process using AI, and here we are!

## Give it a try!

Check out the tool here: [AI-Driven PSD Layer Combiner](https://init-ikuya.github.io/ai-driven-psd-layer-combiner/)

Feel free to try it out and let me know what you think! Any feedback or suggestions are welcome.

Happy designing! 🎨
